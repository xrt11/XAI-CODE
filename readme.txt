'mobilenet_v2(classifier).pth' is the outer classifier that has been trained and would be explained.

'example(explained)_DRUSEN-64262-2.jpeg' is the explained example.

'counter-example(reference)_NORMAL-8614915-1.jpeg' is the reference counter example.

Run the 'case_explain_show.py' file and the predicted result of the example generated by the outer classifier
would be explained using our proposed XAI method, generative images and the saliency map are output as presented in 'CAE_explain_case_show/'

'main_train.py' file is designed for training generator and the discriminator.

The "self.num_classes" parameter in the "MultiClassDis" module in "networks.py" file refers to the number of the image classes (real, fake, normal, disease1, disease2..), which should be changed if the numbers of the image classes change.
